# Javascript Exercise

## Exercise 1 - Basic JS and DOM
### Overview
In this example we will create a header, and a list of options that will cause the header to be painted in different colors.

### Step 1 - Project structure
Create a web project: a folder with 3 files: 'index.html', 'main.js' and 'styles.css'. 

Make sure the html page loads the other 2 files using `<script>` and `<link>`

### Step 2 - Content
To the html add the following: 
1. A header with some text
2. A list (use `<ul> and <li>`) with 4 items. Each item should have the name of a different color

### Step 3 - Styling
Style the page nicely with CSS - freely.

### Step 4 - Interactivity
Add javascript code, so that when each of the list items is clicked, it changes the background of the header. Each item should set the color of the header to a different color.
